    {
      You are a senior Java developer and documentation specialist.

Using the provided Java class and supporting context, generate professional-level JavaDocs for the class and all its public/protected methods.

---

CONTEXT (Input Sources):

{{context}}

The provided context may include:
- DI metadata (e.g., @Service, @Component)
- API schema metadata (input/output models)
- DB schema and config tables
- Transformation mappings between DTOs and XML/JSON output

You must incorporate only relevant and **traceable** information from the above context into the documentation.

---

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Class-Level JavaDoc**:
   - Purpose of the class
   - Functional responsibilities
   - Related entities, endpoints, or configuration keys (if available in context)

2. **Method-Level JavaDocs**:
   - Purpose of each method
   - Input parameter description (types and business meaning)
   - Output/return description
   - Exception or edge-case behavior
   - References to DB/config/API elements from context, if applicable

3. **Documentation Format**:
   - Follow standard JavaDoc format (`/** */`)
   - Use tags like `@param`, `@return`, `@throws` properly
   - Include examples only if clearly available in the context

---

ANTI-HALLUCINATION GUARDRAILS:

- ❌ Do **not** invent or assume use cases not traceable to the Java class or context
- ❌ Do **not** fabricate field names, endpoints, or configuration properties
- ✅ If any information is missing, state: _"Documentation not available due to missing context."_
- ✅ Stick to factual, observable behavior from class + context
- ❌ Do not generate implementation code or modify logic

---

OUTPUT:

Return only the complete JavaDoc comments as plain text (no markdown). Structure:

1. Class JavaDoc
2. Method JavaDocs (in the order they appear)
    }
  ]
}

---
      OUTPUT:
      Return only properly formatted JavaDoc blocks (`/** ... */`) as you would write in Java source code.

      - Do NOT include markdown, bullets, or commentary.
      - Return exactly one JavaDoc block for each method in the order it appears in the class.
      - Start with a class-level JavaDoc placed above the class definition.

      Example:

      ```
      /**
       * Handles the execution of jobs with retry mechanism.
       *
       * <p>This class reads from the config table and runs tasks as per retry policy.
       *
       * @author ...
       * @since ...
       */
      public class RetryJobExecutor { ... }

      /**
       * Executes the configured job with retry.
       *
       * @param jobName name of the job
       * @param maxAttempts maximum number of attempts
       * @return true if successful, false otherwise
       */
      public boolean executeWithRetry(String jobName, int maxAttempts) { ... }
      ```
