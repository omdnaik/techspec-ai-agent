private static final String INTERNAL_DESIGN_DATAMODEL_PHYSICAL="""
  You are a senior database architect. Based on the provided JSON table definitions, generate a **Physical Data Model (PDM)** suitable for enterprise-grade deployment.

  ## Context:
  The JSON includes a list of tables, their columns, data types, and key information. Some tables may include index and foreign key definitions.

  {{context}}

  ## Output Requirements:
  1. Generate SQL DDL statements for each table using a standard RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle â€“ specify which).
  2. For each table, include:
     - Table name
     - Columns with data types
     - Primary key
     - Foreign keys (if any)
     - Indexes (if specified or needed for optimization)
     - Optional: Default values or constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
  3. Ensure naming conventions follow best practices (snake_case for tables/columns).
  4. Do not invent any extra fields or tables that are not in the context.
  5. Avoid hallucination. If key metadata is missing, clearly mention it as a comment in the DDL.

  ## Output Format:
  - Use plain SQL syntax
  - Include clear separation between table definitions
  - Add brief inline comments to explain foreign keys or indexes

  ## Example Output:
  ```sql
  -- Table: app_config
  CREATE TABLE app_config (
    config_key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    config_value TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (config_key)

  - **Purpose**: Encapsulates core business logic and domain models.
  - **Components**:
    - `Deal`, `Trade`, `Counterparty`
    - `DealValidator`, `TransformationRules`
  - **Notes**: Stateless and reusable logic for core business operations.

  #### 4. Persistence Layer
  - **Purpose**: Manages database access and CRUD operations.
  - **Components**:
    - `DealRepository`, `ConfigRepository`
  - **Notes**: Annotated with `@Repository` and use JPA.

  #### 5. Infrastructure Layer
  - **Purpose**: Manages integrations, messaging, and file I/O.
  - **Components**:
    - `MQPublisher`, `XMLGenerator`, `FileStorageService`
  - **Notes**: Abstracted from core business logic.

  ## Task:
  - Analyze the table and column definitions to identify:
    - High-level **entities** and their **attributes**
    - **Relationships** between entities (1:1, 1:N, M:N), where inferable
  - Group logically related columns under conceptual entities
  - Derive **entity names**, **attribute names**, and **optional relationships** without mentioning data types or physical constraints

  ## Output Requirements:
  1. List of Entities:
     - Entity Name
     - Description (optional if context supports)
     - Key Attributes
     - Other Attributes
  2. Relationships (if inferrable):
     - Source Entity
     - Target Entity
     - Cardinality (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
     - Nature of relationship (e.g., "Customer places Order")

  ## Output Format:
  Use structured Markdown as shown below:

  ### Entities

  #### Entity: Customer
  - **Key Attribute**: customer_id
  - **Attributes**:
    - name
    - email
    - phone_number

  #### Entity: Order
  - **Key Attribute**: order_id
  - **Attributes**:
    - order_date
    - total_amount
    - customer_id

  ### Relationships

  - **Customer â†” Order**
    - Type: 1:N
    - Description: A customer can place many orders.

  ## Rules:
  - Do not generate SQL or implementation-specific details
  - Do not hallucinate unrelated entities or attributes
  - If relationships cannot be determined, skip them or add a comment

  Focus on identifying and documenting the major software components of the system, their purpose, key responsibilities, and any important interactions or dependencies between them.

  Guidelines:
  - Only include actual components present in the codebase or architecture.
  - Use class-level JavaDoc summaries (from javadocs.json) to describe responsibilities.
  - Cross-reference DI components and database entities wherever relevant.
  - If components are tied to specific layers (like controller, service, repository), mention that.
  - Include only relevant and existing components; do not hallucinate.

  Output Format:
  - A Markdown table with two columns:
    1. **Component Name**
    2. **Responsibilities**
  - Use concise yet complete technical language.
  - Keep output focused and relevant to the actual system behavior and design.

  Use the following structure:

  ## 3.4 Software Components

  | Component Name | Responsibilities |
  |----------------|------------------|
  | FileProcessorService | Reads and parses incoming deal files; delegates validation and transformation |
