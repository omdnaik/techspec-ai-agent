public static final String SYSTEM_OVERVIEW_PURPOSE_SCOPE = """
As an experienced Solution Architect, you are documenting the System Overview of a Spring Boot Java-based file processing system.
Focus on robustness in terms of maintainability, modular design, scalability, and performance.

---

CONTEXT
{{context}}

The provided context may include:
- System architecture summary
- JavaDoc summary
- DI metadata
- DB schema/config tables

---

DOCUMENTATION GOALS

1. Purpose Overview
- What does the system do? What business problem does it solve?
- Focus on robustness, maintainability, and modularity.

2. Scope
- What functionality or modules are covered?
- Provide a high-level summary only of modules and key features.
- Avoid listing the same feature under multiple headings.

Include:
- Technology Stack
- Key Features (e.g., asynchronous processing, file validation, XML generation, DB interactions)
- Modules (e.g., File parser, Deal processor, XML generator, DB interface)
- Responsibilities of each module

---

ANTI-REDUNDANCY GUARDRAILS
- Do not repeat features or modules across multiple sections unless new context is added.
- If a module is listed in "Modules", do not repeat its features under "Functionality" unless strictly required.
- Use concise bullet-point format. Avoid verbose or repetitive explanations.
- Group similar information logically under one section.

---

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Use clean markdown with bullet points.
- Structure your response into the following sections:
  - Purpose Overview
  - Scope
    - Technology Stack
    - Key Features
    - Modules
    - Responsibilities

Only include information that is clearly verifiable from the context. Do not fabricate system features or assumptions.
Return markdown content only.

private static final String INTERNAL_DESIGN_DATAMODEL_PHYSICAL="""
  You are a senior database architect. Based on the provided JSON table definitions, generate a **Physical Data Model (PDM)** suitable for enterprise-grade deployment.

  ## Context:
  The JSON includes a list of tables, their columns, data types, and key information. Some tables may include index and foreign key definitions.

  {{context}}

  ## Output Requirements:
  1. Generate SQL DDL statements for each table using a standard RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle â€“ specify which).
  2. For each table, include:
     - Table name
     - Columns with data types
     - Primary key
     - Foreign keys (if any)
     - Indexes (if specified or needed for optimization)
     - Optional: Default values or constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
  3. Ensure naming conventions follow best practices (snake_case for tables/columns).
  4. Do not invent any extra fields or tables that are not in the context.
  5. Avoid hallucination. If key metadata is missing, clearly mention it as a comment in the DDL.

  ## Output Format:
  - Use plain SQL syntax
  - Include clear separation between table definitions
  - Add brief inline comments to explain foreign keys or indexes

  ## Example Output:
  ```sql
  -- Table: app_config
  CREATE TABLE app_config (
    config_key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    config_value TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (config_key)
  );

  -- Table: customer_order
  CREATE TABLE customer_order (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
  );
